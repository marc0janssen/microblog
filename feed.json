I used a Micro:bit version2 for this.\n\nThis Simon listens to Button A, Button B, Button C (the touch sensitive logo), Button D (= Button A+B).\n\nIt was fun to create and a good way to set me off with the possibilities of the Micro:bit…\n\n![](https://micro.mjanssen.nl/uploads/2023/f86e4655e0.png)\n\nTo edit this repository in MakeCode:\n\n- open [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)\n- Click Import and select Import URL\n- paste [https://github.com/marc0janssen/simple-simon-says](https://github.com/marc0janssen/simple-simon-says) \n- select import\n\n",

The TL;DR is <strong>keep your content path the same in EMBY and in Sonarr/Radarr</strong>. If you don’t keep them the same, you run into trouble.</p>\n<p>First, I show two options when you can’t keep the paths the same (say you have a linux node running EMBY and a Windows (don’t mention it) node for Sonarr/Radarr. It’s obvious the paths will never be the same, as Linux will give you a PATH like below.</p>\n<pre><code>/home/user/video/movies/Your Old Movie (1921)/Your.Old.Movie.1921.Remux-2160p.mkv\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where Windows (sh*t have to mention it again) will give you a path</p>\n<pre><code>D:\\data\\video\\movies\\Your Old Movie (1921)\\Your.Old.Movie.1921.Remux-2160p.mkv\n</code></pre>\n<p>The slashed only (Linux forward slash / and Windows a backslash \\ ) already makes this a problem.</p>\n<p>Then I will show you two options if you can the PATHs the same. This can be done when:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You run all your software on one node, therefor the content PATHs in EMBY en Sonarr/Radarr will be the same (Obviously)</li>\n<li>When you run multiple nodes of the SAME OS and run the services (EMBY, Sonarr, Radarr) in DOCKER, and therefore you can keep the PATHs the same inside your docker containers.</li>\n<li>When you run multiple nodes of THE SAME OS (for EMBY, Sonarr and Radarr) and store the content on the same network share (a third node) via Radarr/Sonarr and EMBY will scan the content on that same third node.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"option-1-different-paths-you-cant-keep-the-paths-the-same\">Option 1 different paths (you can’t keep the paths the same)</h2>\n<p>This method triggers a <strong>complete</strong> library scan.

				"content_text": "Running Emby en Radarr/Sonarr on different servers or in different container can be a pain in the ass to get your content scanned.\n\nBut it is much easier than you think if you know what’s going on inside the services. The TL;DR is **keep your content path the same in EMBY and in Sonarr/Radarr**. If you don’t keep them the same, you run into trouble.\n\nFirst, I show two options when you can’t keep the paths the same (say you have a linux node running EMBY and a Windows (don’t mention it) node for Sonarr/Radarr. It’s obvious the paths will never be the same, as Linux will give you a PATH like below.\n\n\t/home/user/video/movies/Your Old Movie (1921)/Your.Old.Movie.1921.Remux-2160p.mkv\n\nWhere Windows (sh\\*t have to mention it again) will give you a path\n\n\tD:\\data\\video\\movies\\Your Old Movie (1921)\\Your.Old.Movie.1921.Remux-2160p.mkv\n\nThe slashed only (Linux forward slash / and Windows a backslash \\\\ ) already makes this a problem. \n\nThen I will show you two options if you can the PATHs the same. This can be done when:\n\n1. You run all your software on one node, therefor the content PATHs in EMBY en Sonarr/Radarr will be the same (Obviously)\n2. When you run multiple nodes of the SAME OS and run the services (EMBY, Sonarr, Radarr) in DOCKER, and therefore you can keep the PATHs the same inside your docker containers.\n3. When you run multiple nodes of THE SAME OS (for EMBY, Sonarr and Radarr) and store the content on the same network share (a third node) via Radarr/Sonarr and EMBY will scan the content on that same third node. \n\n## Option 1 different paths (you can’t keep the paths the same)\nThis method triggers a **complete** library scan. This work fine but is suboptimal. When your library is large, or you frequently trigger the library scan, it will have an impact on EMBY.\n\n\t  curl -X POST \"${EMBY_HOST}/Emby/Library/Refresh?api_key=${EMBY_APIKEY}\" --data \"\"\n\nWhere:\n\n\tEMBY_HOST = http:/192.168.1.1:0896 or https://www.yourdoamin.com:443\n\t\n\tEMBY_APIKEY = XXXXXXYYYYYZZZZZZ \n\n## Option 2 different paths (you can’t keep the paths the same)\nThis method tiggers a scan for a certain library in your collection (EMBY\\_PARENT\\_ID). The advance to the pervious option is that you only trigger one collection in the library. The downside is you have to fiddle around with the EMBY\\_PARENT\\_ID. These can be obtained from the URL when you open the collection in EMBY.\n\n\tcurl -X POST \"${EMBY_URL}/emby/Items/${EMBY_PARENT_ID}/Refresh?Recursive=true&MetadataRefreshMode=Default&ImageRefreshMode=Default&ReplaceAllMetadata=false&ReplaceAllImages=false&api_key=${EMBY_APIKEY}\" -H \"accept: */*\" -d “”\n\nWhere:\n\n\tEMBY_HOST = http:/192.168.1.1:0896 or https://www.yourdoamin.com:443\n\t\n\tEMBY_APIKEY = XXXXXXYYYYYZZZZZZ \n\t\n\tEMBY_PARENT_ID = 12\n\n## Option 3 Same paths (you can keep the path in \\*arr equal to the path in EMBY)\nThis is the simplest to configure the default trigger in Sonarr/Radarr\n\n![](https://micro.mjanssen.nl/uploads/2023/f53508d5ef.png)\n\n## Option 4 Same paths (you can keep the path in \\*arr equal to the path in EMBY)\nThis method tiggers a scan for a certain library in your collection. The advance to the pervious option is that you add your own logic to the scan. The other advance is that you can fill-out **Path** and **UpdateType** from the environment variables in Linux (or your container)\n\n\t  curl -X POST \"${EMBY_URL}/emby/Library/Media/Updated?api_key=${EMBY_APIKEY}\" -H \"accept: */*\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"Updates\\\":[{\\\"Path\\\":\\\"${Path}\\\",\\\"UpdateType\\\":\\\"${UpdateType}\\\"}]}\"\n\nWhere:\n\n\tEMBY_HOST = http:/192.168.1.1:0896 or https://www.yourdoamin.com:443\n\t\n\tEMBY_APIKEY = XXXXXXYYYYYZZZZZZ \n\t\n\tPath = /movies/Old Movie, The (1921)/The.Old.Movie.1921.Bluray-2160p.mkv\n\t\n\tUpdateType = [ Created | Modified | Deleted ] (optional)\n\nHere is an example script I use for Radarr and Sonarr.

We zijn nu sinds corona 3 jaar verder, ik ben weinig meer op het station. Het is nu thuiswerken. Ik denk nog wel eens aan hem. En of hij nu nog steeds bij het station staat. En of hij soms nog wel eens wat te eten krijgt van iemand. Of eigenlijk hoop ik dat hij zelf dat broodje kan gaan kopen, want dat zou ik deze vriendelijke man van harte toewensen. \n\n\n",

This is a warning not a “showstopper”.\n\n\t## Version 2022/09/08\n\t# make sure that your dns has a cname set for jellyseerr and that your jellyseerr container is named jellyseerr\n\t\n\tserver {\n\t    listen 80;\n\t    server_name jellyseerr.*;\n\t    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;\n\t}\n\t\n\tserver {\n\t    listen 443 ssl http2;\n\t    server_name jellyseerr.*;\n\t        server_name jellyseerr.yourdomain.com;\n\t        resolver 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 valid=300s;\n\t        resolver_timeout 10s;\n\t        gzip on;\n\t        gzip_vary on;\n\t        gzip_min_length 1000;\n\t        gzip_proxied any;\n\t        gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml application/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript image/svg+xml;\n\t        gzip_disable \"MSIE [1-6]\\.\";\n\t        \n\t    location / {\n\t            proxy_pass http://192.168.1.1:5055;\n\t            proxy_read_timeout    90;\n\t            proxy_connect_timeout 90;\n\t            proxy_redirect        off;\n\t            proxy_set_header      Host $host;\n\t            proxy_set_header      X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n\t            proxy_set_header      X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n\t            proxy_set_header      Proxy \"\";\n\t        }\n\t        \n\t        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n\t        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;\n\t        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; \n\t}\n\n### fail2ban - jail.local\nAdd the configuration below to the file: /path/to/dir/swag/config/fail2ban/jail.local\n\nThe path /jellyseerr\\_log/ should be added to your docker-compose.yml of **SWAG**.\n\nThis config let the intruder try 3 times, if failed within 10 minutes they’re blocked for 1 hour.

I use the following version of the driver, <a href=\"/files/mmc.o\" title=\"Driver MMC SD Card\">you can download it here</a>. This driver needs to be placed in the directory.</p>\n<pre><code>/lib/modules/2.4.30\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to install the kernel modules for vfat filesystem support, so we can mount the MMC/SD card. To do this you need the following package kmod-vfat 2.4.30-brcm-5</p>\n<p>Now all the needed software is installed on the router. We can start testing the mod. You have to execute the following command to add vfat support to the kernel</p>\n<pre><code>root@Hellhound:~# insmod fat\nusing /lib/modules/2.4.30/fat.o\n\nroot@Hellhound:~# insmod vfat\nusing /lib/modules/2.4.30/vfat.o\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we are ready to test the soldering, make sure you have an SD card installed in your socket. Remember that theoretically the driver supports 2GB cards, but what I have found on the web and personally experienced is that a 2GB will not work. The largest card support is 1GB. Now execute the following command on the prompt.</p>\n<pre><code>root@Hellhound:~# insmod mmc\nUsing /lib/modules/2.4.30/mmc.o\nTo check if the mod is working execute the following command\nroot@Hellhound:~# dmesg\nmmc Hardware init\nmmc Card init\nmmc Card init *1*\nmmc Card init *2*\nSize = 14400, hardsectsize = 512, sectors = 28800\nPartition check:\nmmca:\n</code></pre>\n<p>The orange LED on the router should light up. If you get an error, make sure you have a GPIO2 driver installed, otherwise recheck your soldering.</p>\n<p>Now we are ready to mount the MMC/SD card. Execute the following command at the prompt.</p>\n<pre><code>root@Hellhound:~# mkdir /tmp/mmc\nroot@Hellhound:~# mount -tvfat /dev/mmc/disc0/part1 /tmp/mmc\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will mount your MMC/SD card to the mount point /tmp/mmc.

In the beginning I didn&rsquo;t do a mask of the GPIO pins and that caused my mod to be unstable, and the router would lock up.

This is something vfat does not support. So we need to format the card in EXT2. To do this, we have to install the package e2fsprogs 1.38-1.

Make sure it is dismounted.</p>\n<pre><code>root@Hellhound:~# mkfs.ext2 /dev/mmc/disc0/part1\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the card is formatted, we create a file /etc/fstab with the following code</p>\n<pre><code>/dev/mmc/disc0/part1 /opt ext2 defaults 0 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now instal the package kmod-ext2 2.4.30-brcm-5 to give the kernel EXT2 support.

To test if the card is mountable , try the following:</p>\n<pre><code>root@Hellhound:~# insmod ext2\nroot@Hellhound:~# mount /opt\n</code></pre>\n<p>To check if the card is writeable, you can check it by coping a file to it or so.

				"content_text": "### What is it?\nActivityPub is the glue or the oil, if you like, for the Fediverse. It glues all the services together in the Fediverse. It lets mastodon servers communicate with each other, but it also lets Pixelfed talk with mastodon and vice versa. All the social media that is ActivityPub aware can exchange messages with each other.\n\n### WordPress \nWordPress is by its nature not ActivityPub aware. So, it can’t exchange messages with the Fediverse. But there is a solution. [Matthias Pfefferle](https://github.com/pfefferle \"Matthias Pfefferle\") created a [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-activitypub \"Wordpress ActivityPub\") to connect WordPress to the Fediverse. This enables you to get your WordPress posts across the Fediverse.\n\n### What do you need\n1. [Webfinger WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webfinger/ \"Webfinger WordPress Plugin\") installed on your WordPress instance;\n2. [ActivityPub WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/ \"ActivityPub WordPress Plugin\") installed on your WordPress instance.\n\n### Setup\nThere is not much needed to get this working. Installed both plugins. The ActivityPub plugin has default settings that could work for you, but fiddle with them if you like. The Webfinger plugin doesn’t need configuration at all. When both plugins are installed, you will see it advises you for 2 more plugins. They are not needed to get ActivityPub working. But will enhance the experience.\n\n### Checking the setup\n1. First check the Site Health under Tools \\> Site Health. If all is working correctly, you will get no critical errors on this page. \n2. Go to the [Webfinger website](https://webfinger.net \"Webfinger Website\") and check if you get a JSON response from your ActivityPub plugin by entering the e-mail address at the top. **HINT: This is not your regular e-mail address, but the account name and domain name of your WordPress instance.** So, if you have an account “Jake” on your WordPress instance at the domain “great.blog.com”, your “e-mail address” will be jake@great.blog.com. You can enter it at the top of the page. As a result, you should get a JSON response.\n3. Go to your Mastodon account and search for your WordPress account (i.e., jake@great.blog.com) in the search bar of Mastodon.\n\n### Dos and Don'ts and Hints\n1. _**Don’t install**_ a cache enhancing plugin. It will mess with the ActivityPub or Webfinger Plugin. You will see critical errors after a while in your Site Health menu.\n2. I found that [[mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) ]([mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) \"mastodon.social\")messes with the avatar. It will not come through, even after a few posts on WordPress. I checked a few other mastodon instances (also mastodon.online, which is the other flagship server) they were fine. So, you should be careful with the mastodon server you choose to test this. It could make you think the plugin isn’t working properly.\n3. Some hosting providers protect the **.well-known** directory. When this directory is inaccessible for the plugin. It will not work. (This made me host my WordPress instance at home).\n\n\n",
